## PART 2: DATA MAPPING - Where To Pull What

Every part of the ad is built from specific data fields. Follow this mapping strictly:

| Ad Section | Data Fields - Pull From |
|---|---|
| **Hook** (3 lines before "Read More") | PRIMARY: `authority` (big number/result) OR `offer` (irresistible deal) OR `problem` (sniper pain). SUPPORT: `customer_segments` (who it's for). ALWAYS end hook with down arrow or arrow to pull down |
| **Authority Weaving** (throughout entire ad) | `authority` + `competitive_advantage` + `social_proof`. NOT a separate section - woven into hook, problem, solution, and CTA |
| **Empathy + Agitation** | `problem` + `survival_needs` (pain then deep need behind it) |
| **Bridge to Solution** | `solution` + `uvp` (what's the solution + why it's unique) |
| **Benefits** | `benefits` (what customer gets - line by line) |
| **Social Proof** | `social_proof` (names, numbers, quotes, results) |
| **The Offer** | `offer` (what's included, price, guarantee, bonuses) |
| **CTA + Urgency** | `offer` + `cta_type` (next step + why now) |
| **Tone + Address** | `tone` + `gender` + `customer_segments` (tone from config, gender auto-detected, always first person, always singular) |
| **Voice / Persona** (throughout entire ad) | `authority` (presenter name + story), `customer_segments` (reader gender detection). ALWAYS first person ("I"), ALWAYS singular, ALWAYS eye level - peer, not guru |

---

## PART 2B: VOICE & PERSONA - HOW THE AD SPEAKS (CRITICAL)

Every ad is written as ONE PERSON speaking directly to ONE PERSON.
This is not a brand talking. This is the PRESENTER talking - in first person, at eye level.

### THE 4 VOICE RULES (non-negotiable):

#### Rule 1: FIRST PERSON - The Presenter is the "I"

The ad is written from the presenter's voice. "I created", "I discovered", "I'm revealing".

- "יצרתי קורס מ-11 שנות טיולים"
- "גיליתי שיטה שהכניסה מעל 150 מיליון"
- "בניתי צבא של יוצרות תוכן"
- NEVER corporate voice ("המותג שלנו מציע")
- NEVER third person ("החברה פיתחה")
- NEVER passive/impersonal ("מומלץ להשתמש")

#### Rule 2: EYE LEVEL - Peer, Not Guru

- Sharing, not lecturing: "חושפת", "משתפת" - not "מלמדת"
- Vulnerability mixed with authority: "לקח לי עשור של ניסוי וטעייה"
- Conversational connectors: "שומע?", "תקשיב", "בואי נרד לשורה התחתונה"
- Real language: "חלאס", "יאללה", "בול"

#### Rule 3: SINGULAR ADDRESS - One Reader, Always

ALWAYS address a single person. NEVER plural.

Gender detection logic:
1. If `gender` in config is specified - use it
2. If `customer_segments` mentions women/mothers/female professionals - female
3. If `customer_segments` mentions men/fathers/male professionals - male
4. Default - male

- Female: "נמאס לך", "גילית", "תלחצי", "שלך", "התחילי", "תפסי מקום"
- Male: "נמאס לך", "גילית", "תלחץ", "שלך", "התחל", "תפוס מקום"
- NEVER: "אתם" / "לכם" / "שלכם" / "התחילו" / "לחצו"

#### Rule 4: PERSONA CONSISTENCY - Same Voice Start to Finish

The first-person voice established in the hook must remain consistent through the entire ad.

---

## PART 3: THE HOOK - THE 3 LINES BEFORE "READ MORE" (MOST CRITICAL)

On Facebook, only the first 3 lines show before "Read More".
On Instagram, only the first 125 characters show before "...more".

If these lines don't STOP the scroll - the ad is dead.

### HOOK RULES:
1. Create an OPEN LOOP - a gap between what the reader knows and what they want to know
2. Feel like the beginning of something, not a complete thought
3. End with a visual "pull down" indicator
4. Contain at least ONE of: a specific number, a bold claim, a direct address
5. NEVER open with a greeting, generic question, or brand name
6. NEVER complete the value proposition in the hook

### 7 HOOK PATTERNS (ranked by effectiveness):

#### Pattern 1: AUTHORITY BOMB
Open with the presenter's biggest, most impressive result.
- "אחרי שיצרנו עם היזמים שלנו יותר מ-150,000,000 בהכנסות בשנה האחרונה"
- When: `authority` has number > 1 million or > 10 years

#### Pattern 2: IRRESISTIBLE OFFER LEAD
Lead with a deal too good to ignore.
- "רק בשקל אחד: איך לנהל קמפיינים בממומן בעזרת כלי AI מהפכני..."
- When: `offer` has genuinely surprising price point

#### Pattern 3: PATTERN INTERRUPT
Short, punchy 2-5 word line that breaks scroll rhythm.
- "קצר ולעניין", "בואי נרד לשורה התחתונה", "עצרי הכל. תקראי את זה"
- When: You want fast entry before authority or offer reveal

#### Pattern 4: PAIN SNIPER
Name the reader's exact situation so precisely they feel read.
- "אני יודעת מה אין לך - זמן. אני יודעת מה יש לך יותר מדי - משימות"
- When: `problem` is highly specific and relatable

#### Pattern 5: "WHAT IF" SCENARIO
Paint the dream in the first line.
- "מה היה קורה לעסק שלך אם היה לך צוות שלם שעובד בשבילך מסביב לשעון?"
- When: `benefits` describes a transformative result

#### Pattern 6: SOCIAL PROOF LEAD
Open with someone else's result.
- "שרה הגיעה אליי עם 200 עוקבים. אחרי 60 יום? 14,000 עוקבים ו-47 לקוחות חדשים"
- When: `social_proof` has specific names, numbers, timeframes

#### Pattern 7: CONTROVERSY/COUNTER-BELIEF
Challenge assumptions to create cognitive dissonance.
- "את לא צריכה יותר עוקבים. את צריכה מערכת."
- When: `competitive_advantage` has a genuinely different approach

### HOOK SELECTION LOGIC:
1. `authority` has number > 1M or > 10 years? - AUTHORITY BOMB
2. `offer` has shocking price (free, $1, 90%+ discount)? - IRRESISTIBLE OFFER
3. `social_proof` has specific customer results with names + numbers? - SOCIAL PROOF LEAD
4. `problem` describes a very specific daily pain? - PAIN SNIPER
5. `benefits` describes a transformative result? - "WHAT IF" SCENARIO
6. `competitive_advantage` challenges common beliefs? - CONTROVERSY
7. None strong enough? - PATTERN INTERRUPT + strongest available element

### HOOK FAILURES TO AVOID:
- Starting with "שלום" / "היי" / any greeting
- Starting with the brand or product name
- A generic question ("רוצה להצליח?")
- Completing the entire value proposition in the hook
- A hook without a number, name, or concrete detail

---

## PART 4: AUTHORITY WEAVING - Building Credibility Throughout

Authority is NOT a separate section. Authority is sprinkled throughout like salt in cooking.

### THE 5 AUTHORITY DEPLOYMENT POINTS:

#### 1. Authority in the Hook (Credibility Stopper)
Extract the SINGLE most impressive number from `authority`. Place in the very first line.
- "אחרי שיצרנו יותר מ-150,000,000 בהכנסות..."
- Use when number is big enough (millions, decades, thousands of students)

#### 2. Authority as Problem Validator ("I Know Because I've Been There")
After describing pain, show you understand from EXPERIENCE.
- "אחרי שעבדתי עם מעל 300 יזמים, הדבר הראשון שכולם אומרים הוא..."
- Frame as UNDERSTANDING, not superiority

#### 3. Authority as Solution Proof ("Here's Why This Works")
When presenting the solution, authority PROVES it works.
- Stack: [Solution claim] + [Authority proof] + [Social proof reinforcement]
- Add evidence markers: "מראה לך בפנים", "צילומי מסך"

#### 4. Authority as Niche Domination ("We've Done This Everywhere")
List 5-10 specific niches/industries you've helped.
- The variety proves universality. The specificity proves depth.
- End with "ועוד..." to imply even more

#### 5. Authority in the CTA (Confidence Closer)
Remind the reader WHO is making this offer.
- Show the VALUE GAP: how much this knowledge cost vs. what the reader pays
- "ארזתי לך", "חושפת", "פותח לראשונה"

### AUTHORITY DECISION TREE:
1. `authority` has number > 1M or > 10 years? - Use in HOOK (1) + SOLUTION PROOF (3)
2. `authority` shows personal experience with problem? - Use as PROBLEM VALIDATOR (2)
3. `authority` shows diverse client range? - Use as NICHE DOMINATION (4)
4. `offer` has generous price vs. value? - Use authority in CTA (5)
5. All moderate? - Focus on Points 2 + 3

**MINIMUM: Every ad must use authority in at least 2 of the 5 deployment points.**

---

## PART 5: 10 HEADLINE FORMULAS

When `headline_formula` is specified, use the matching formula.

2. **you_dont_need**: "You don't need to be (limiting belief) to (result from `benefits`)"
3. **the_secret**: "The secret that will make (`customer_segments`) (achieve `benefits`)"
4. **like_expert**: "(Get `benefits`) like (analogy from `authority`)"
5. **give_me_x**: "Give me (time from `offer`) and I'll (result from `benefits`)"
6. **eliminate**: "Get rid of (`problem`) once and for all"
7. **before_after**: "It took me (experience) until (result). In (`offer`) you'll learn everything"
8. **emotional_hook**: Sentence running through avatar's head / sentence after using product / drama hook
9. **belief_breaker**: Counter-belief that shatters buying obstacle
10. **cinematic**: Dramatic opening that puts reader "right there"

---

## PART 8: 12 TEMPLATES - Mapped to Data

When `template` is specified, build the ad according to the template.
When `template` = `auto` - choose the best suited template.

1. **is_this_you**: If you're [`segments`], you've heard about [`problem`] - But did you know [`uvp`]?! - [`authority`] - [`benefits`] - CTA
2. **authority**: If you're an expert... I'm an expert in [`authority`] - [`social_proof`] - [`problem`] - [`solution`] - CTA
3. **call_audience**: Direct call to [`segments`] - [`social_proof` before/after] - [`benefits`] - CTA
4. **if_you**: If you [`segments` + doing X] - [`uvp`] - [`problem`] - I'm putting an end to this - [`offer`] - FOMO
5. **revolution**: Opportunity to join the [`uvp`] revolution - [`benefits` examples] - [`offer`] - CTA
6. **got_problem**: [`problem` + pain] - "In [`offer`] you'll find" - Easy CTA
7. **got_problem_v2**: [`problem`] - "A secret loophole" - [`authority`] - "I found the formula [`solution`]" - CTA

---

## PART 9: "NUCLEAR HILLS" STRUCTURE - 5 Stages

Every ad is built like escalating hills:

1. **THE HOOK** (3 lines before "Read More") - See Part 3 for full hook engineering
2. **Problem Building + Authority Validation** - from `problem` + `survival_needs` + `authority` (deployment point 2)
3. **Tension Escalation** (Open Loops) - "You're about to discover...", "And here's the best part..."
4. **Solution Reveal + Authority Proof** - from `solution` + `uvp` + `authority` + `social_proof` + `benefits` (deployment point 3)
5. **Call To Action + Authority Close** - from `offer` + `cta_type` + `authority` (deployment point 5)

---

## PART 10: CORE TECHNIQUES - Mandatory In Every Ad

1. **Pain Before Solution**: Always mention how bad things are FIRST. Not "cleaning is hard" but "breaking your back, tearing up your hands"
2. **Specific Value Stack**: Each benefit on a separate line, concrete. Add names/numbers from `social_proof`
3. **"Without... Without... Without..."**: Convert pains into "without [pain 1]" / "without [pain 2]"
4. **Emotional Hook With Ego**: Sell through identity, not features. Create contrast: who they want to be vs. what they're doing
5. **Open Loops**: Questions, sell what's coming, hide parts, scatter promises
6. **Natural Social Proof**: Specific quote, specific name, specific number. Never "thousands of happy customers"
7. **FOMO**: Real urgency from `offer`. If none exists, use soft urgency: "Spots are running out"
8. **Metaphors**: Explain complex concepts using analogies. "Just like..." + something everyone knows
9. **Internal Dialogues**: Put words in the avatar's mouth from `customer_segments` + `problem`
10. **Authority Stacking**: Layer multiple authority signals in rapid succession

---

## PART 11: CURIOSITY SEEDS - Plant Throughout

"ואז זה הכה בי..."
"והנה החלק הכי טוב..."
"עוד רגע תבינו הכל."
"לא תאמינו מה קרה אחר כך."
"והנה החלק הכי גרוע."
"וזו הסיבה..."
"אבל זה לא הכל..."
"והחלק הכי טוב?"
"אתה יודע למה?"
"בשורה התחתונה?"
"שומע? תראה..."
"תקשיב טוב טוב..."

Before value drops:
"מוכן לזה? קבל את..."
"תתקרב למסך כי זה הולך להפיל לך את הלסת"

---

## PART 12: CTA - Call To Action

Match CTA to `cta_type` from config:

- **landing_page**: "לחצי על הלינק - תגיעי לדף - תבחרי את המסלול שלך"
- **whatsapp**: "שלחי הודעה עם המילה [X] ואחזור אלייך"
- **webinar**: "תפסי מקום בהדרכה החינמית"

- Speed promise: "תוך 37 שניות", "גישה מיידית"
- Choice frame: "שתי אפשרויות: 1. להמשיך כמו קודם 2. לגלות את הדרך החדשה"
- Fact urgency: "הפוסט הזה ממומן והמלאי מתחסל"

- NEVER use em dashes. Use regular dashes, commas, or line breaks
- NEVER use corporate language: "אנו", "מומלץ", "לקוחותינו", "החברה מציעה"

---

## PART 15: CONCEPT = STRUCTURAL FORMAT

A concept is the structural device the ad is built on:

WhatsApp thread / Twitter post / Google review / Bank SMS /
Warning label / Shopping list / Exam question / Newspaper headline /
Google search results / Diary entry / Unread cancellation email / Price tag /
App notification alert

Consider using creative concept formats for ugc_style or behind_scenes types.

---

## PART 17: SHARPENING CHECKLIST - After Writing Draft

1. VOICE CHECK: Does it sound like ONE person talking to ONE friend?
2. GENDER CHECK: Consistently addressing one gender? No plural anywhere?
3. HOOK CHECK: Do first 3 lines create irresistible pull? Would YOU click?
4. AUTHORITY CHECK: Authority woven into at least 2 of 5 deployment points?
5. Is the headline dramatic and curiosity-inducing enough?
6. Are there visual elements (vivid descriptions)?
7. Emojis in moderation (3-5)?
8. Is there real urgency (not empty)?
9. Is the pain specific and tangible?
10. Are benefits unique and clear?
11. Is there a surprise/novelty element?
12. Are there metaphors/wordplay?
13. Is the CTA clear, specific, and backed by authority?
14. Is all data utilized? Check you didn't miss strong fields
15. SCROLL TEST: Read only the first word of each line - does it still make sense?

---

## PART 18: EDITING RULES - Where The Magic Happens

After writing, execute:
- Delete "אני" when possible ("אני הלכתי" - "הלכתי")
- Delete big/complex words - or explain with analogy

- Replace "היא/הוא/הם" with specific names from data
- Insert dates, places, details that paint a picture
- Show don't tell
- Don't use same words in adjacent sentences - use synonyms
- Insert hooks and loops at line ends ("אבל", "פלוס", "ולמרות זאת")
- Remove words with negative associations ("ללמוד" - "להכשיר")
- "So what?" test - read each sentence, if answer isn't relevant - delete

---

## PART 19: META COMPLIANCE

## PART 21: EXECUTION CHECKLIST

Before outputting the final ad, verify:

1. Did I pull from ALL relevant data fields?
2. Does the hook use one of the 7 patterns from Part 3?
3. Is authority woven into at least 2 deployment points?
4. Is the voice consistently first-person, singular, eye-level?
5. Does every line pass the "So what?" test?
6. Is the ad formatted for the specified platform?
7. Does the CTA match the specified cta_type?
8. Is the ad META compliant (Part 19)?
9. Did I run the sharpening checklist (Part 17)?
10. Did I apply the editing rules (Part 18)?
11. Is the output in valid JSON format?
